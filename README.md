## Fitness App ##
# Description
   I aim to make a fitness application, with the main focus on running, cycling, swimming and other cardiovascular sports. A secondary focus on weightlifting and strength training.
   I have used many applications for this in the past, however none have met my full requirements, and there may be a good reason for that. But I will attempt to add all, what I believe,
   are nessarcary features, such as (but not limited to)
                               - routines
                               - calender/schedule
                               - running log table with ability to search and filter
                               - user login to store personal details
                               - use of basic features with out a sign up

# Tech Stack

   * Typescript - there will be many types used within the data
   * Bootstrap - for frontend basic styling
